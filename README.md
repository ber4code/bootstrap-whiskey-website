# Whiskey Drop Website

**Welcome!**

This is a sample project undertaken in the **_3rd Module_** of my **_Coding Bootcamp_** with the 
**_Code Institute_**.

It is a hypothetical website for a specialist whiskey business which delivers a new and exciting 
whiskey to your door on a monthly basis.

It is a **_1-page interactive website_** including a **_pop-up modal_** which displays upon 
clicking a **_Sign Up!_** button. The website was first set out with **_semantically appropriate HTML_**. 

**_BOOTSTRAP_** classes were applied to this HTML to give it its **_initial styling_** in an expeditious 
manner.

**_Google Fonts_** was used to update the text style.

Finally, a separate **_CSS_** file was created to **_apply styles and organise_** the website to give it a 
professional and distinct look.

The technologies/resources utilised in this website are as follows:

| HTML    | Bootstrap   | CSS            | Google Fonts | Git            | GitHub           |
